I had no idea how much was written about this issue until I faced it today. "Solutions" range from completely resetting your iOS device to strange rituals involving updating your Apple ID's Country/Region setting or altering your DNS.

For me, disabling "Set Automatically" in `Settings > General > Date & Time` did the trick.
